            When you find a job you'd like to apply for, don't start filling in
            the application form straight away. Take some time to prepare, as
            this will make the task much easier. Gather together all the
            information that you'll need, including details of your academic
            achievements, employment history and contact information for your
            referees. You'll make a great first impression if you do your
            research - find out the aims of the company you're applying for, the
            sector they operate in and who their main competitors are. Browsing
            their social media channels is a good place to start. Study the job
            description so that you can refer back to the specific skills and
            qualities that the employer is looking for as you complete the form.
            Finally, read the instructions carefully to ensure that you complete
            the correct sections of the form and know when the deadline is.
